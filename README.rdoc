In the first project for the CodeClan course, I was tasked to create an application to help a record store owner (Harvey) keep track of their inventory.  To achieve this, I utilised Ruby with the Sinatra framework for the front end, while using PostgreSQL for the database.  

The app allowed for the user to input, edit, and delete artists, albums and stock, and the database schema was organised as a one to many relationship between artists and albums, and another one to many relationship between albums and stock.

The user would be warned if stock levels are running low with a colour coordinated stock level indicator.  Further, the capability to add album artwork was incorporated as an additional feature, in order to make the design more interesting.
